This is the project I credited during the 13 week course at [DevMountain](https://github.com/devmountain).
Similar to Duolingo, this is the project I learned angular on. It is an app to teach Danish to native
English speakers. The app contains the first lessons inside unit one, with placeholder images for the
remaining units. The account dropdown and sidebar navigation are also for demo purposes, they do not have
actual links. The lessons consist of eight different card types. I built a custom directive for each of
those card types. As you cycle through my lesson array stored in Mongodb, the custom directives hide/show
themselves based on the current slide.
